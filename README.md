# Real-Time-Large-Scale-Orthophoto-Maps-Generation-via-3D-Gaussian-Splatting-SLAM


## 🔍 Overview

GS-OrthoSLAM is a real-time, incremental orthomosaic generation system built upon a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM framework.  
The proposed method enables large-scale, online orthophoto generation from UAV imagery, achieving high orthogonality, sharp building boundaries, and stable visual quality under challenging aerial scenarios.
